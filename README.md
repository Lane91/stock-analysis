# Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project
### Purpose
This project is to help Steve run anaylsis on multiple diffrent stocks in order to help his parents invest in the most profitable stocks. The challenge was to take the code that we made in the moduel and refactor it to encompass more range of stocks and to run quicker.



## Analysis 
The refactored code combined the code of module 2 and module 3, along with re-writing parts of the code from module 2 in order to encompass a wider range of the stock and shave off time.

## Summary
### Pros & Cons of refactoring code
The pros are that refactoring can make your code quicker and cleaner allowing it to do more under one macro as opposed two having multiple macros to do one job. The main cons of refactoring code is time which you may not always have, and another con is that if you are not carful it is very easy to loose your place or write the wrong code in the wrong spot and having to go back multiple times to fix it.

### Orginal Code VS Refactored Code 
The orginal coe was broken up over two modules and ran in a slower time, where as the refactored code was all under on macro and had a quicker run time as well as giving back more accurate information on the stocks.
